I am a fan of offline, native applications. Even though there are web apps out there to modify image / apply filters - I was looking for one native to Ubuntu. I found one called [Polarr](https://www.polarr.co/linux-electron?platform=polarr&label=homepage_website) and I am blown away by it!
Right after starting, it gave me a guided tour - and Look what I made!

What sets it apart are:

- Extremely Friendly User Interface
- Good performance
- Detailed options like clarity, Feather, Exposure Grain
