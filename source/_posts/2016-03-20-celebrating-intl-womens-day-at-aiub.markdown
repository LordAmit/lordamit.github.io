On 20th March, 2016 - I gave a speech at American International University-Bangladesh, in an event to celebrate International Women's Day and to encourage women in technical fields. This event was organized by IEEE AIUB Student Branch and Google Women TechMakers Bangladesh group.

I talked about the past, and the present, and shared my own experience in software industry, so that together, men and women can create a better future.

You can view the slides here, but it is not supposed to be completely understandable without my speech. But oh well!
