I switched from Blogspot to Octopress about a year ago. Even though my blogspot site was search engine friendly, was getting about 10K views per month when I was regular, and contained details about all of my useful works - I still decided to switch to Octopress - for a fresh start.  Why?

Because I found that Blogspot is incredibly slow and rusty. It is of course, useful with all the widgets and such - but it still is <i>slow</i>. That's when Salman, a young fellow I consider a brother to me, suggested me about Octopress. I loved this, and here I made this blog. After an year, I decided to analyze the response. Here is the result right from Google Webmaster.
