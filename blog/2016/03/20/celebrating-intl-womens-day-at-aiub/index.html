<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>I studied many articles before preparing this Presentation. However, the most notable ones are:</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="notes-i-made-when-i-was-preparing-for-it">Notes I made when I was preparing for it</h2>

<p>I started preparing for it about a month ago, and wrote notes. I use MarkDown syntax for creating notes and planning, by the way. You should get an idea about what I wrote and what I talked about from here:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="gh"># Presentation on Motivating Women in STEM</span>

<span class="gu">## Key factors</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Motivate
<span class="p">-</span> Do not discourage

<span class="gu">## Points to Note</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Women in earlier computer science and coding
<span class="p">    -</span>   Figures / Idols
<span class="p">-</span> Women in present STEM
<span class="p">    -</span> Lack of women compared to earlier periods
<span class="p">    -</span> Statistics (1/4 in STEM)
<span class="p">    -</span> Less Paid
<span class="p">    -</span> Still Idols

<span class="gu">## Reasons</span>
<span class="p">
-</span> Stereotypical idea about women:
<span class="p">    -</span> Loves to gossip
<span class="p">    -</span> Are not analytical
<span class="p">    -</span> Weak

<span class="gu">## Problems Why Companies Do Not Want to take women</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Does not want to stay after work hours
<span class="p">-</span> Will take maternity leave for weeks (22 in Bangladesh)!
<span class="p">-</span> Won't be able to give support from home in case of emergency
<span class="p">-</span> has to take care of husband when HUSBAND is sick!!

<span class="gu">## Facts</span>
<span class="p">-</span> No conclusive study about lack of analytical ability in women
<span class="p">-</span> In fact, no stereotypical comments are valid!
<span class="p">-</span> Can work just as hard as men
<span class="p">-</span> Women good structured programmer example

<span class="gu">## What to do</span>
<span class="p">
-</span> Start from home. Teach children that women and men are different, but not superior or inferior in any way
<span class="p">-</span> Allow your children to break toys!
<span class="p">-</span> Don't be afraid to speak up about your needs in job. Chances are, men have no idea that you need those, even though they are willing to cooperate
<span class="p">-</span> The women who are leading, took a bold step, against the normal norms of society. We need to make that a habit.

<span class="gh"># Tips for Preparing Slides</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Abnormality
<span class="p">-</span> Don't use templates
<span class="p">-</span> Flat Colors #5FA6A9 Green, #C84D64 RED, #EAAE54 Paste , #2B2937 black , #4968AB yellow
<span class="p">-</span> Use good fonts (Helvetica? )
<span class="p">-</span> Use Images
<span class="p">-</span> BIG is beautiful
<span class="p">-</span> Info-graphics</code></pre></figure>
